        <p>Qinhe’s chosen photograph is of a selection of tickets from various events. This image is significant because it shows both a personal and relatable history. The history is personal because it is a collection of her favourite events, and her animations will most likely involve overlaying personal photos taken during those trips. The image is also relatable because thousands of people attend those events so the chances are that some people coming across her page will also be invited to remember their experiences either at those specific events or at ones that are similar. </p>

        <p> The article <a href = “https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdBZc3C97h2PBsNEqcZT-dm6afvbz69jONaE96eW-qF3Q84CA/viewform?usp=sf_link”> 10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</a> walks the reader through the pertinent steps involved in accurately and effectively analysing images. The steps are specifically aimed at teachers and other instructors and breaks down the skills in such a way that they can use them to teach their students the concepts. The steps are: be detectives, practice regularly, ask open ended questions, notice details, build on other’s observations, adapt questions for all subjects, expand knowledge of the world, start conversations, introduce new ideas, and experiment with other ways to look closely. Today I applied these concepts to the website <a href = “dogstudio.co”> DogStudio.</a> On the website a black, wolfish looking dog hangs in the background; it is zoomed out, turned, and has its colors changed as the user explores the page. It also passively blinks and moves slightly as it floats in order to give the impression of something that is alive. I think that this imagery is used because the website is for a branding company specializing in creating unique impactful imagery therefore the dog is both an example and a medium to show the product of their services.

        <p>In <a href = “https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c”>Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</a> Naema Baskanderi explains the dos and don’ts of pop-ups and defines the basic interface structure. Some of the appropriate usages of a pop-up include grabbing a users attention, when user input is needed, and to show additional information. Baskanderi warns not to use pop-ups for feedback related messages. There are a few key elements that make up a well designed pop up. For one, they should be easily closeable AND -for ideal accessibility- closeable via keyboard commands.A good title will help users understand the content they are looking at, and sizing and location should also be appropriate to the content. Other good tips included: naming buttons clearly, darkening the background, and letting popups be user initiated. Overall I think Baskanderi’s tips were clear, digestible, and useful.

        <h2>Journal One:</h2>
            <p>The article <a href=”https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f” >“Best Practices for Form Design”</a> discusses their 20 recommended tips for designers to create forms that are intuitive, legible, and navigable. Their tips included directions such as showing feedback, prioritizing accessibility, and intentional labeling. I found tip number nine “size fields accordingly” to be the most useful because it was not something I had considered before. Sizing fields accordingly means to ensure that the length of a field box reflects the length of the answer that will be typed inside. Overall, employing as many of the recommended practices as possible will not only help users understand what a form is asking for, but it will help ensure they fill it out as efficiently and correctly as possible.
