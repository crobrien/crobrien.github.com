        <p>In <a href = “https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c”>Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</a> Naema Baskanderi explains the dos and don’ts of pop-ups and defines the basic interface structure. Some of the appropriate usages of a pop-up include grabbing a users attention, when user input is needed, and to show additional information. Baskanderi warns not to use pop-ups for feedback related messages. There are a few key elements that make up a well designed pop up. For one, they should be easily closeable AND -for ideal accessibility- closeable via keyboard commands.A good title will help users understand the content they are looking at, and sizing and location should also be appropriate to the content. Other good tips included: naming buttons clearly, darkening the background, and letting popups be user initiated. Overall I think Baskanderi’s tips were clear, digestible, and useful.

            <p>The article <a href=”https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f” >“Best Practices for Form Design”</a> discusses their 20 recommended tips for designers to create forms that are intuitive, legible, and navigable. Their tips included directions such as showing feedback, prioritizing accessibility, and intentional labeling. I found tip number nine “size fields accordingly” to be the most useful because it was not something I had considered before. Sizing fields accordingly means to ensure that the length of a field box reflects the length of the answer that will be typed inside. Overall, employing as many of the recommended practices as possible will not only help users understand what a form is asking for, but it will help ensure they fill it out as efficiently and correctly as possible.
