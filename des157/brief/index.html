            <h2> For my final project I plan to create a website that helps people with anxiety make phone appointments.</h2>
    <p>The most similar website I could find was <a href = “https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E3fUt5fQldcMM5zrzrtUc3CKY6LDOPFssjC7Ah14Foc/edit?usp=sharing”> this one, </a> however this site is a set of steps and FAQ section regarding booking appointments aimed at helping individuals with Autism. Stylistically this site is not very attractive. The colors are jarring and the text styling is heavy, overall the site comes off as very overwhelming due to cognitive load. The only thing working well I think is their overall organization of the information has a good flow.</p>
    <p> The next website I could find that was comparable <a href = “http://www.sfhp.org/files/providers/Resources_Improving_Patient_Experience/Pt-Ex-SEHC-Phone-Triage-Script.pdf”> -here- </a> was closer  because it was about providing an exact script. However, this site shows a flow chart which is difficult to read and very hard to follow, especially on the spot. This site is closer conceptually to what I am trying to create but still not quite there.</p>
    <p>My goal is to reduce the anxiety involved in booking appointments by providing users with a personalized script that they can use while making calls and sending emails. By doing this I hope to help people connect to the help that they need more effectively in a way that is flexible and customizable. The customization of my provided script is what will set my project apart from existing websites and allow people to have more assurance when booking appointments. </p>
    <p> Visually my goal is to calm and gently direct users. I want my website to feel like it is holding their hand through the process and offer reassurance during this stressful process. To achieve this I will work with light, calming colors, minimize cognitive overload by using minimalist interfaces, and prioritize clarity through intentional hierarchy and blocking.</p>
    <p> My interactions will be performed through JavaScript. I will use functions to collect user responses and insert them in the appropriate spaces of a prewritten skeleton script. This will also be clearable so that users can adjust their answers without having to leave the website. I will use CSS to add some small animations in order to entertain the tone of relaxation and safety.</p>
    <p> My goal for my audience is to give them the opportunity to successfully book a doctors appointment with the aid of my customizable script, and reduce their anxiety while doing so. I am hoping that a site like mine will encourage and guide people to seek help when they need it and help dissolve the barriers around doing so.</p>
